# CardioVision
This project implements a deep learning-based pipeline to predict heart attack risk levels by analyzing retinal fundus photographs. Retinal images are a rich source of microvascular patterns that can indirectly indicate systemic health conditions, including cardiovascular risk.

The model identifies subtle changes in retinal blood vesselsâ€”such as narrowing, microaneurysms, or hemorrhagesâ€”which have been linked in medical research to heart disease. By detecting these features, the system outputs a continuous risk score or categorical classification (e.g., Low, Medium, High risk) for potential cardiovascular events.

This approach enables non-invasive, cost-effective, and early detection of heart attack risk, making it suitable for integration into eye clinics, primary care centers, and mobile screening setups.
